Your voice a lasting echo
Your heart a solitary beating drum
Your voice a lasting echo
Your breath that in the willows makes a song
Such a beautiful song
Gracefully, gracefully
As gentle as a summer breeze
How you move in me
So imperfectly
Tell me how you bring
Such heavenly things
On those human wings
Your voice a lasting echo
Your spirit a silence that within me moves
Your voice a lasting echo
In the winter of my sorrows you make all things known
All things known
Gracefully, gracefully
As gentle as, as gentle as a summer breeze
How you move in me
So imperfectly
Tell me how you bring
Such heavenly things
On those human wings
On those human Wings
On those human wings
Oh
How you move in me
So imperfectly
Tell me how you bring
Such heavenly things
On those human wings
On those human wings
On those human wings
Oh

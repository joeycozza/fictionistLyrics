I know we'll find a way
Know we'll find a way 
to bring you home.
to bring you home
Cause I recall a time
when life was more than living on a dime

People came and went, left you by yourself
all alone
you're all alone
nowhere to go
nowhere to go
nowhere to go
nowhere to go

tonight between these walls
the darkest curtain calls are from your heart
away from home

Well I'd rise above the tide
the sirens lullaby is just as bright

The others standing by, 
wait to catch their lies
to bring you home
to bring you home
nowhere to go
nowhere to go
nowhere to go
hey

nowhere to go
and on this lazy summer afternoon
the sun is sinking slowly far beyond the hills
everybody's hanging on your words
oh what a thrill
yeah

and on this lazy summer afternoon
its hard to hide what you've been hiding all along

all the voices blaring in hour head, 
say you don't belong

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Hey
Nowhere to go

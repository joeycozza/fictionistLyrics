The righteous suffer
and the wicked go free
I live in the middle
so whats gonna happen to me

You know you cant have something for nothing
Nothing around here's free
You always gave me
your best advice
If I were a better man
I wouldn't think twice
But I'm not foolish
You know that everythings got its price

And I've spent all this time
on this tightrope hill
now you'll have to excuse
this iron will

So take it or leave it 
I dont suppose that you will need it
Take it for granted
Oh how the worlds so heavy handed
Take it or leave it
My eyes were closed but I can see it now.
My eyes were closed but I can see it now.

So middle minded
and hard to please.
Is this the good life
or some kinda disease
when it always takes disaster
to bring you to your knees

And I've spent all this time
on this tightrope hill
But it doesnt mean this blood
is meant to spill

So take it or leave it 
I dont suppose that you will need it
Take it for granted
Oh how the worlds so heavy handed
Take it or leave it
My eyes were closed but I can see it now.
My eyes were closed but I can see it now.
My eyes were closed but I can see it now.

All of our troubles,
neatly pressed in piles

Waiting for redemption
all in single file

We got one tear for heartache
another tear for pain

Future's broken mirrors
hanging in their frames

And oh, we're gonna give it all away this time
Yeah, we're gonna give it all away this time
Hey

Wicked imaginations
all fueled by fear
keep us in our places
year after year

We got one tear for heartache
another tear for pain
drowning in our depths 
and now we're burning in our flames

And oh, we're gonna give it all away this time
Yeah, we're gonna give it all away this time
Hey

Ah, we're bound for the door, hanging in the sky
yeah we're gonna give it all away this time.
oh yeah

Lines drawn in the sand
by the invisible hand
it's make believe
it's make believe

Lines drawn in the sand
by the invisible hand
it's make believe
everything you see

building walls, building walls
so high, so tall
you know it's make believe
everything you see

Lines drawn in the sand
by the invisible hand
it's make believe
everything you see
you know it's make believe
everything you see

oh we're gonna give it all away this time.
yeah we're gonna give it all away this time.

Hey, we're bound for the door, hanging in the sky
yeah we're gonna give it all away this time.

This time
This time
yeah
This time
This time
yeah
This time

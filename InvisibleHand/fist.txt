Here I am, looking like a suckerfish against the glass
In a daze, ever since you left I've been living in the past
And from this window I can see, you're standing in the street
Breathing in and breathing out, I can feel your heart beat

There it is, a loss of love that I sent long ago
In a daze, returning it to sender with my mouth all full of crow
And if you want me back, you gotta to let me know
Cause these clouds are heavy black, they're hanging mighty low
And if you change your mind, you gotta let me go
On living life, that's the way it's gonna be.
That's the way it's gonna be

Here I am, looking like a suckerfish against the glass
Wondering, if there's anything a man can do to change the past
All these years you'd think I'd ask, how to spell relief
The lessons lost along the path, it's a novel kind of grief

Come on down, and mend a broken bone so I can stand at ease
I've been around, so save me from my heartache and my sorrow if you please
And if you want me back, you gotta let me know
Cause these clouds are heavy black, they're hanging mighty low
And if you change your mind, you gotta let me go, 
on living life. That's the way it's gonna be

The way it's gonna be
Yeah
The way it's gonna be
Yeah
The way it's gonna be

Ah, that's the way it's gonna be
The way it's gonna be
Yeah, yeah
That's the way it's gonna be, hey
The way it's gonna be, yeah

She's got a fist full of tears
I know the pain is wrapped around the years

Noisy birds, noisy birds.
Singing at the break of dawn. 
How dare they wake such a miserable man
with their singing and their carrying on

Where'd they get the idea 
they could be so fancy and free
These noisy birds got it all wrong,
you gotta hand your head like me.
You gotta hang your head like me.

Lady left about an hour ago
to bring me home some bread
I've sunk deeper than the ocean floor
on this feather bed

Dont they know that I've been 
tossing and turning this whole night through
These noisy birds noisy birds 
what am I gonna do?
Yeah what am I gonna do?

The birds rise with the sun
Well she's gone with the birds
I slept like a mummy wrapped so tight
Yeah and noone telling me
But the sparrows singing in the tree
Noones telling me
Not a soul
Not a soul

Noisy birds, noisy birds.
Singing at the break of dawn. 
How dare they wake such a miserable man
with their singing and their carrying on

Where'd they get the idea 
they could be so fancy and free
These noisy birds got it all wrong,
They gotta hand your head like me.

These noisy birds got it all wrong,
You gotta hand your head like me.
Yeah,
You gotta hang your head like me.
You gotta hang your head like me.
Hey!

Thinking of you thinking of me
Thinking of you thinking of me
Thinking of you thinking of me
Always thinking

Somewhere across town
I know you're having a day
Rubbing shoulders with powerful men
In a casual way

Maybe you don't know...

You make manic (what can I do?)
I just go manic (what can I do?)
You are the substance of a dream
I had while I was 17

You make manic (what can I do?)
You make manic (what can I do?)
You got me dangling by your string
And I think I'm gonna scream
You make me...

Do it to you like you do it to me
Do it to you like you do it to me
Do it to you like you do it to me
Do-a-do it

You got my number, I know you do
Just shoot me a text
Don't say you're like the other girls


And I like you, Yes I like you

You make manic (what can I do?)
I just go manic (what can I do?)
You are the substance of a dream
I had while I was 17

I go manic (what can I do?)
You make manic (what can I do?)
You got me dangling by your string
Look at me dangling

You make me...

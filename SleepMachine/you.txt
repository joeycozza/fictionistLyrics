You
I'm not prepared for you
You caught me by surprise

Me
Content and unsuspecting
I was satisfied

You
I searched the world for you
But you were nowhere to be found

Back then
I would have killed to know you
But things are different now

You
You somehow frighten me
Your memory will not let me be

But I live
The life I understand
And that's enough for me

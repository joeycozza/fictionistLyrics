I've got something that I've got to say
It's been eating away at me
I've been tempting fate by running from the truth
I didn't want to believe

I can hear 'em say
Wake up, smell the roses
Can't you see my brightened signs (?)
Wake up, smell the roses
But I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye

Lately I get lost in my thoughts
Don't know why they've been so hard to follow
I keep tempting fate by never doing today
When there's always tomorrow

I can hear 'em say
Wake up, smell the roses
Can't you see my brightened signs (?)
Wake up, smell the roses
But I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
I, I, I don't want to say goodbye
I, I, I, I don't want to say goodbye
I, I, I don't want to say goodbye

Out of daylight suns still bleeding
This is our time, This is our time
Wide awake yet somehow dreaming
This is our time, This is our time

We got our whole lives
Lets take our sweet time.
We stay up all night
Cause we can sleep when we die

I know it aint so, but it sure feels like
This is our time, This is our time
We're the only ones on earth tonight

We got our whole lives
Lets take our sweet time.
We stay up all night
Cause we can sleep when we die

Cause we can sleep when we die
Cause we can sleep when we die

Out of daylight suns still bleeding
Wide awake yet somehow dreaming
We stay up all night
We stay up all night

Cause we can sleep when we die
Cause we can sleep when we die
Cause we can sleep when we die

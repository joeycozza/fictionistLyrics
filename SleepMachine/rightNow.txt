Woke up this morning
I finally had a clear head
Night fog had lifted
Could finally see straight ahead

So mysterious, so illogical
In this clarity, showing up too late
Somehow obvious, yet illogical
Such a bitter pill to taste

If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I wanted you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
It's right now

Out from the masses (?)
Trying to escape the fumes (?)
I declared independence
From everything including you

So mysterious, so illogical
In this clarity, showing up too late
We are two halves of the same whole
Separate us and we bleed

If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I wanted you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
It's right now

If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I wanted you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there ever was a time that I needed you
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there was a time, if there ever was a time
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there was a time, if there ever was a time
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there was a time, if there ever was a time
(It's right now, it's right now)
If there was a time, if there ever was a time
(It's right now, it's right now)

Five in the morning
He's up with the birds
Combs his hair and goes early to work

He sits at his desk
And he stares at the screen
Thinks of every pace he's ever been
Every place he's never been

Working stiff, do you need a lift?
Seems like you need a little something
Working stiff, do you need a lift?
Seems like you need a little something
Something, something, yeah!

It's cold comments to declaim you as their own
I'm a stranger out there and even stranger at home
Oh-oh, oh-oh, it's so hard not to feel alone

So I went out to kill some of these small town woes
But the lights were down and all the stores, they were closed
Oh-oh, oh-oh, so we drove home in the snow

So take me with you
I'm gonna make my great escape
I think I'm ready
I think I'm ready for a change

So we called the sky, they put us on hold
Ever since we settled down and now we're just growing old
Oh-oh, oh-oh, settled down and growing old
So do we play or do we fold

So take me with you
I'm gonna make my great escape
I think I'm ready
I think I'm ready for a change

I think I'm ready for a change
So hold steady and turn the page

Take me with you
I'm gonna make my great escape
I think I'm ready
I think I'm ready for a change

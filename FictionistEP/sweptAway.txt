The flood come rushing down the canyon
But we didn't run for higher ground
Took a deep, deep breath and reached for your hand
And we were down, down, down
Ride until we reach the ocean
We're gonna ride until we reach the sea
With the planets we've been set in motion
Feel the gravity
I was swept away
Yeah, you were swept away
Not knowing what would follow
I was swept away
Yeah, you were swept away
And now it's sink or swallow
And now it's sink or swallow
I found myself in the city
High above and looking down
When she speaks it sounds like rushing water
And I am lost in sound
I was swept away
Yeah, you were swept away
Not knowing what would follow
I was swept away
Yeah, you were swept away
And now it's sink or swallow
And now it's sink or swallow
I was swept away
You were swept away
Not knowing what would follow
I was swept away
Yeah, you were swept away
And now it's sink or swallow
And now it's sink or swallow

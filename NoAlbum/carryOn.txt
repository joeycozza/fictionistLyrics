I was a child just yesterday
yesterday I swear I was a child
Trouble chased that innocent youth away
left me reckless, restless and wild

From the garden I awoke
To the city's blinding light
the earth shook when the heaven spoke
like a siren in the night

whats done is done.
whats gone is gone
there comes a time when you gotta find the heart to carry on
you spend your whole life, your whole life hanging on
but there comes a time when you gotta find the heart to carry on
to cary on

I laid in bed and I was worried sick
about the child that I couldnt save.
heaven in that moment was a mystery to me.
couldn't be any farther away

From the garden I awoke
to a brilliant day
the earth shook when the heaven spoke
a most mysterious way


whats done is done.
whats gone is gone
oh but there comes a time when you gotta find a heart to carry on
you spend your whole life, your whole life hanging on
oh but there comes a time when you gotta find the heart to carry on
oh but there comes a time when you gotta find the heart to carry on
oh but there comes a time when you gotta find the heart to carry on
carry on
carry on

??? The honest fade
so give me somewhere that I can put my fate
Give me something

So save the praise, 
don't waste a kiss
I've been distracted but 
I cant afford to miss this moment

Still Reaching
We're still reaching
Hands up were gonna reach a little higher
Still reaching
we're still reaching
Even if we gotta walk through fire

Lost my step
slipped in a dream
your lips move but I'm somewhere in between
I can't hear you

And who I am,
I can't stand
but in another life 
I'll be a different man
I'll be so different

I wont bend 
and I wont break
so give me love or give me nothing for heaven sake
Dont wanna miss, I cant afford to miss this.

So save the praise, 
don't waste a kiss
If I'm gonna go,
dont let me go like this
dont let me go.

Still Reaching
We're still reaching
Hands up were gonna reach a little higher
We're still reaching
we're still reaching
Even if we gotta walk through fire

Treasure these moments and love
We got to treasure these moments and love
Oh we gotta love

I see the ashes, I see the dust
you're made of metal, i see the rust
I cant believe it we aint kids no more

Have you ever tried to count the cars on a train
when it was moving an inch from your face
I cant believe it we aint kids no more

Surely happening I dont know why slipping further from me the more I try

We got to treasure these moments and love
We got to treasure these moments and love
Oh we gotta love

You graduated, your pants are pressed
all you needed was someone to impress
Young forever and care free

I saw you punch in in the morning and the boss write out your check
smiling at the party and your life's a wreck 
It's a young professional so lonely and free

Surely happening I dont know why slipping further from me the more I try

We got to treasure these moments and love
We got to treasure these moments and love
Oh we gotta treasure these moments and love
and love love love love love

We got to treasure these moments and love
We got to treasure these moments and love

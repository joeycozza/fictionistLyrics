There's a girl I've been seeing
So understanding
She can sense what I'm thinking
And what I feel
Yeah, she knows me better
Than I know myself
But still I'm afraid to open up

Cause there's a part of me I keep under lock and key
I can't let no one in
I fight alone against the ghost that's haunting me
There's a part of me I can't let no on see
I can't let no one in
I keep it under lock and key

I'm awake for the most part
I go through the motions
All my friends like my company
At least they're always telling me so
But It's not like I'm pretending
To be something I'm not
There's something else beneath the surface
I want to share it but I get nervous
I can't open up

Cause there's a part of me I keep under lock and key
I can't let no one in
I fight alone against the ghost that's haunting me
There's a part of me I can't let no on see
I can't let no one in
I keep it under lock and key

Even though I'm scared I think I love you
Even though I'm scared I think I love you

There's a part of me I keep under lock and key
I can't let no one in
I fight alone against the ghost that's haunting me
There's a part of me I can't let no on see
I can't let no one in
I keep it under lock and key

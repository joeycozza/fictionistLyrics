I miss you.
Doesn't that count for something?
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do, 
if I'm really in love with you?

I miss you.
I'm wonderfully miserable.
This love's cast a shadow
over everything that I know.

My heart's at zero gravity,
takes nothing short of war to get through to me.
So please don't hold it against me.
Because I miss you.
Do you miss me too?

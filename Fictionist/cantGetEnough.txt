I'm running circles round a fleeting patch of white.
The mystery that paint, the tongue, and pen failed to describe.
From what those before me said The things I've felt the books I've read.
I believe it's you and I can't get enough.

I can't get enough.

So don't you leave me baby at the drawing board.
I'll drown amongst my thoughts without you
waiting at the shore.
So come to me despite the blue.
Extend your hand love me too.
Cause I can't get enough.

I can't get enough.
I can't get enough.
I can't get enough.

Last night I woke up in a cold sweat.
River of doubt running through my head.
I dreamed you up and left me.
And over time managed to forget me.
Last night I woke up in a cold sweat.
River of doubt running through my head.
But then I felt your body there.
I felt your body there.
I can't get enough.
Last night I woke up in a cold sweat.
River of doubt running through my head.
I dreamed you up and left me.
And over time managed to forget me.
Last night I woke up in a cold sweat.
River of doubt running through my head, But then I felt your body there.
I felt your body there.

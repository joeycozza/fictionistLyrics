There's an ominous feeling hanging on the air tonight.
Creeping up through the floorboards, telling me something ain't right.
So now I need you, pretty baby, to come and ease my mind.
'Cause there's an ominous feeling, that I can't deny

How do you know when to give it up?
How do you know when to give it up?
Something tells me I should hold on
If it feels so right, could it be so wrong?
How do you know when to give it up?

All my luck's dried up
The ropes tighten up around my wrists
I keep wrestling the urge to turn around and call it quits
But there's a fire still burning
Somehere deep at the heart of this
And I can feel it on your touch, hear it on your voice,
Taste it on your lips

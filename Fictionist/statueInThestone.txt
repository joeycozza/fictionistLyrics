Hey looking glass
have you got a minute.
This is looking bad 
No matter how you spin it.
I fight alone, this uphill battle.
Is it too late to turn back now?

I didn't speak a single word since 
my eyes could see paint chippin on the celing.
And above my bed, inside my head 
there's a voice that's screaming let me out.

I am young but I have grown
to stand alone.
I'm the statue in the stone.
I'm alive and I am ready 
to face the unknown.

I've got to find a new direction.
Been on my knees in the intersection.
And I need it now, now more than ever.
To get this whole thing turned around, turned around.

I am young but I have grown
to stand alone.
I'm the statue in the stone.
I'm alive and I am ready 
to face the unknown.

OOOOOHHHH, I'm the statue and the stone.
OOOOOHHHH, I'm alive and I am ready.
OOOOOHHHH, ready to face the unknown.
To come into my own.

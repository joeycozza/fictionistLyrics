You were a cut-string kite
Thread clipped on a gusty night
Caught up in a dream
From the mouth of the machine

But the love you left, it still remains
Hangs in the air like a sacred strain

You were a burned-out sun
Cold star on the run
A mind split at the seams
Lit match to a paper dream
But the love you left, it still remains
Hangs in the air like a sacred strain.

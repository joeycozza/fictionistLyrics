Isn't it strange when its pouring rain
In a place as dead as this?
I've got a chill in my bones
from an anxious unknown
I tasted on your kiss
Such a curious thing 
when the gods start to wring
their rags out over the desert
And we're both feeling down
but it ain't on account 
of the water or the weather

This love is sych a fickle thin
Baby, have you come to ruin me?

I'm not over you yet
I'm not over you yet
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

Curse the dead leaves
How they laugh and tease
They gossip under my feet
How on earth have I been so blind
How could I be no naive?
My mind's the autobahn as I lie awake
Trying to make sense of what you had to say
Now I can't sort it out 
You left me in a cloud of doubt
But it don't change my mind anyway

I'm not over you yet
I'm not over you yet
I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

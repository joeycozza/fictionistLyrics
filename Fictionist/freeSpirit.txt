I don't know, I guess I'm tired
Wound up wasting the wire
Now I'm lost somewhere in between
A bright future and a terrible dream

But you don't have to stick around
If you don't want to
You don't have to stick around
I couldn't force you

You've got a free, free spirit
Just say the word and I'll set you free
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word, just say the word
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word and I'll set you free
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word, just say the word

Whatever it is you see in me
'Cause you don't understand the need to believe
And I'll tread lightly on my sacred ground
Take not for granted the love I found

But you don't have to stick around
If you don't want to
You don't have to stick around
I couldn't force you

You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word and I'll set you free
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word, just say the word
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word and I'll set you free
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word, just say the word

You're standing somewhere high
Heart racing and you're out of breath
Your love is higher than a skyscraper
All smiles but you're scared to death

But you don't have to stick around
If you don't want to
You don't have to stick around
I couldn't force you

You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word and I'll set you free
You got a free, free spirit
Just say the word, just say the word

Just say the word
Just say the word, just say the word
Just say, just say, just say, just say
Just say the word, just say the word

I'm a City at war
The kids are gathering in the street
Crying justice and they raised their flag
I think they're crying for relief.

Ahhh.

Uniforms flood the street.
Keep the angry youth at bay
I watch the scene from high above
I don't know who's side to take

I love you
And I'll fight to prove it.
I can't escape the skin I'm living in
No matter how hard I try to do it
to do it
to prove it

Who can I trust?
When every arm that I know is flesh
In myself I see a father, a brother,
a sinner, son, and saint
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Don't let me turn into the things I hate.

I love you
and I'll fight to prove it
but I can't escape the skin I'm living in
No matter how hard I try to do it
to do it
to prove it

Who can I trust if I cant trust myself?
I cant escape the skin im living in
No matter how hard I try to do it
to do it
to prove it

Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims
Please don't let my loved ones be the victims

Leave the light on,
leave the light on,
leave the light on for me.
I'm on my way now,
I'm running fast as these legs can carry me.

Leave the light on,
leave the light on,
leave the light on for me.
You have been patient,
yes you have waited a lifetime for me.

Am I any of the things that you hoped for
when you were an innocent girl?
I have given you nothing but
ordinary things:
A life among lives, a house among houses,
but you deserve the world.

Leave the light on,
leave the light on,
leave the light on for me.
I'm headed home now,
I'm running fast as these legs can carry me.

Am I any of the things that you hoped for
when you were an innocent girl?
I have given you nothing but
ordinary things:
A life among lives, a house among houses,
but you deserve the world.
